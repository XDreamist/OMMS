# copy-webpack-plugin

Copies individual files or entire directories, which already exist, to the build directory.

## Getting Started

To begin, you'll need to install `copy-webpack-plugin`:

```console
npm install copy-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

or

```console
yarn add -D copy-webpack-plugin
```

or

```console
pnpm add -D copy-webpack-plugin
```

Then add the plugin to your `webpack` config. For example:

**webpack.config.js**

```js
const CopyPlugin = require("copy-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new CopyPlugin({
      patterns: [
        { from: "source", to: "dest" },
        { from: "other", to: "public" },
      ],
    }),
  ],
};
```

> ℹ️ `copy-webpack-plugin` is not designed to copy files generated from the build process; rather, it is to copy files that already exist in the source tree, as part of the build process.

> ℹ️ If you want `webpack-dev-server` to write files to the output directory during development, you can force it with the [`writeToDisk`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware#writetodisk) option or the [`write-file-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/gajus/write-file-webpack-plugin).

> ℹ️ You can get the original source filename from [Asset Objects](https://webpack.js.org/api/stats/#asset-objects).

## Options

- **[`patterns`](#patterns)**
- **[`options`](#options-1)**

The plugin's signature:

**webpack.config.js**

```js
const CopyPlugin = require("copy-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new CopyPlugin({
      patterns: [
        { from: "source", to: "dest" },
        "path/to/source", // absolute or relative, files/directories/globs - see below for examples
      ],
      options: {
        concurrency: 100,
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

### `Patterns`

- [`from`](#from)
- [`to`](#to)
- [`context`](#context)
- [`globOptions`](#globoptions)
- [`filter`](#filter)
- [`toType`](#totype)
- [`force`](#force)
- [`priority`](#priority)
- [`transform`](#transform)
- [`transformAll`](#transformAll)
- [`noErrorOnMissing`](#noerroronmissing)
- [`info`](#info)

#### `from`

Type:

```ts
type from = string;
```

Default: `undefined`

Glob or path from where we copy files.
Globs accept [fast-glob pattern-syntax](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#pattern-syntax).
Glob can only be a `string`.

> ⚠️ Don't use directly `\\` in `from` option if it is a `glob` (i.e `path\to\file.ext`) option because on UNIX the backslash is a valid character inside a path component, i.e., it's not a separator.
> On Windows, the forward slash and the backward slash are both separators.
> Instead please use `/`.

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new CopyPlugin({
      patterns: [
        "relative/path/to/file.ext",
        "relative/path/to/dir",
        path.resolve(__dirname, "src", "file.ext"),
        path.resolve(__dirname, "src", "dir"),
        "**/*",
        {
          from: "**/*",
        },
        // If absolute path is a `glob` we replace backslashes with forward slashes, because only forward slashes can be used in the `glob`
        path.posix.join(
          path.resolve(__dirname, "src").replace(/\\/g, "/"),
          "*.txt"
        ),
